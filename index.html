    <p>
        Hello world. I am pleased to introduce myself, to the technological world, as a full stack software engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past 5 years, I have been intrigued by the ideas and concepts of ingenuity. The qualities of being clever, original, and inventive brought me into the world of engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent time at different jobs where I learned how to better myself in the realm of problem solving, critical thinking, stress management and many other soft skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowing that the way of world required innovation, in regards to technology, I decided to enhance my marketability by learning what the world around us requiers, technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I am now as your future web developer, prepared to take on future endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please feel free to navigate through my site and contact me for any advice, comments, questions, or concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
        I look forward to building with you!
